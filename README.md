### What is Collab19?

Collab 19 is a DAO that fights COV19.

### Why a DAO?

By creating a decentralized autonomous organizataion (DAO) people from all over the world can come together to fight COV-19. The Collab19 DAO created a democratic system of participation for anyone who has onboarded via the Collab19_bot interface to vote and democratically decide on how to best distribute funds to people in need.
